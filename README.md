500pxDemo
=========

A small demo created for Android using some 500px APIs.
The images are retrieved parsed from the homepage.

It is optimal in no way.  The views are not perfect.
It is a proof of concept.

Improvements...
Images can be retreived and limited by size using the 500px api and the images can be better placed within ImageViews.
